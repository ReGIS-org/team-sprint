# EDAL
EDAL can be used to set up a WMS service (Web map service).
The easiest way is using the [ncWMS](https://github.com/Reading-eScience-Centre/ncwms) application. 
This can be done in different ways.

## Starting ncWMS standalone with a jar file 

```bash
$ curl -L -O https://github.com/Reading-eScience-Centre/ncwms/releases/download/ncwms-2.2.11/ncWMS2-standalone.jar
$ java -jar ncWMS2-standalone.jar
# 1. open in web browser: localhost:8080
# 2. click on: Admin interface (admin/admin)
# 3. add under Datasets / Required data / Location: path and name of data file (.nc)
# 4. add under Datasets / Required data / ID: random string
# 5. click on Save configuration
# 6. Reload page until State: LOADING changes to State: READY
# 7. results can be found under: ncWMS Frontpage
```

## Starting ncWMS with docker

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 guygriffiths/ncwms
# open in a web browser: localhost/ncWMS
# to add new data: click on Admin interface (ncwms/ncwns)
# other steps: like steps 3-7 above
```

Or with another [dockerfile](https://github.com/axiom-data-science/docker-ncwms).

`docker pull axiom/docker-ncwms`

```bash
$ docker run \
    -d \
    -p 80:8080 \
    -p 443:8443 \
    axiom/docker-ncwms
 ```
 
Note that saved data stored on a docker container may disappear after the container is stopped.

## WMS API
The API provided by ncWMS includes the default WMS specification, and additional parameters that control the visuals, e.g. the colormap. The API specification can be found [here](https://reading-escience-centre.gitbooks.io/ncwms-user-guide/content/04-usage.html). 

## DataCatalogue
ncWMS provides an admin interface where you can add data. The admin page talks to the [NcwmsCatalogue](https://github.com/Reading-eScience-Centre/ncwms/blob/master/src/main/java/uk/ac/rdg/resc/edal/ncwms/NcwmsCatalogue.java). This is an implementation of the [WMSCatalogue](https://github.com/Reading-eScience-Centre/edal-java/blob/master/wms/src/main/java/uk/ac/rdg/resc/edal/wms/WmsCatalogue.java) and an extension of the [DataCatalogue](https://github.com/Reading-eScience-Centre/edal-java/blob/master/xml-catalogue/src/main/java/uk/ac/rdg/resc/edal/catalogue/DataCatalogue.java).

An example of how the catalogue is being used to update the config, including adding files, can be found in the [NcwmsAdminServlet class](https://github.com/Reading-eScience-Centre/ncwms/blob/master/src/main/java/uk/ac/rdg/resc/edal/ncwms/NcwmsAdminServlet.java#L254).
