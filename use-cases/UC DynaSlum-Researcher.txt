DynaSlum - Researcher

Description:
Scientists want to create, improve and expand data-driven models of slum dynamics. 
The researcher should have some data on the slum, create and fit a model, and validate the model with held-back data.

Actors:
- Social scientists
- Social geographers
- Public health Scientists

Preconditions:
- Slum data
- Range of possible model parameters/models
- Choice of validation metrics

Flow:
- Upload slum data
- Set model parameters
- Run simulation
- Display prediction with ground truth
- Display computed validation metrics (error percentage)

Exceptions:
- Slum data in wrong format
- Impossible model parameter

Postconditions:
- Display model prediction on map
- Display difference between prediction and ground truth
- Display overlap between prediction and ground truth
- Display model validation metrics
