DynaSlum - Policy maker

Description:
Development of policies for slum formation and composition. A policy maker can change parameters of a proposed policy and simulate its effect based on a loaded model (that has been validated before). The changes on the slum since the change in the policy should be visualized as a result.

Actors:
- Government/County/City official
- Urban planner
- Economic developer

Preconditions:
- Validated model
- Simulation settings (time, etc.)
- Visualisation settings (shape-difference map, composition-difference map)
- Range of possible policy parameters (should the policy maker have knowledge of the models?)

Flow:
- Load validated model
- Set policy parameters
- Run simulation
- Display prediction
- Display change since t=0

- Change policy parameters
- Rerun simulation
- Display prediction
- Display change since t=1
- Display change since t=0
- Display provenance

Exceptions:
- Unfit model
- Impossible combination of policy parameters
- Impossible sequence of policy parameters

Postconditions:
- Show shape of simulated slum
- Show slum composition difference
- Show slum shape difference
- Show migration between slums
- Show sequences of policy parameters
