Use Cases eEcology - Stefan Verhoeven


Description:
The goal of eEcology is understanding behavior of different species, types and genders of birds.
Birds are tagged with GPS tracking devices to track their movement and behaviour over space and time.


Actor:
Biologist focused on behaviour who wants to annotate gps tracking data 


Preconditions:
- Aivalable bird tracking data in csv format
  with timestamp, altitude, latitude, longitude, speed2d, device-id, direction, birdname 
- Trained classifier

Flow:
- user uploads data in system
- system stores data in database
- database interprets and annotates data using classifier
- annotated data is visualized in 'data view' (graphs, charts) and 'map view'
- user checks and adapts annotations  
- annotation is stored in database 
- user publishes annotated data
- user provides feedback to classifier?

Exceptions:
- Unsupported data formats
- Incomplete geo information

Postconditions:
- Data is displayed on map
- User is able to adapts annotations  

- Visualizatie van pad 
- Kleuren voor herkend gedrag in pad
