Use Case Flagship

Description:
Local geopatches are studied in more detail than global areas and the collection of total local models should be more informative than the best global model. 
A researcher should be able to submit data or a model to a particular location. In cases of benchmarks, Regis should run a submitted model on the available data. 

Actors:
- Hydrologist
- Geologist

Preconditions
- Dataset (soil model)
- Model (soil dynamics simulation)

Flow:
- Select tile
- Supply model
- Regis runs simulation
- Display results
- Compare results to known info for tile
- Suggest other models/tiles

Exceptions:
- Corrupted data
- Model won't run

Postconditions:
- Visualizations of results
